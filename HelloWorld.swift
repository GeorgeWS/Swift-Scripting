#!/usr/bin/swift

/*
	Run any Swift file from the command line using:
	
		swift FileName.swift
	
	Or, to make it executable, just add this line to the top of the file:
		
		#!/usr/bin/swift
	
	Then make the file executable in the command line using:
	
		chmod +x FileName.swift
	
	And run the file like so!
	
		./FileName.swift
	
	That's it! Enjoy scripting with Swift! For more information, see:
